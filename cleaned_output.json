Do kids ever get enough?When it’s time to close the store, they will always ask for moreBut that is lifeWhen youLove me, love me, I’m just a lonely boy, give me soda pop and toysLove me, love me, please a little candy girl, take those chocolates from the boys(They're eating, They're eating, They're eating way too fastThey're eating, They're eating)And this is for the devil in the picture that you couldn’t believeIt’s the truth of the agony you couldn’t achieveSo where’s your daddy sleeping over? Why did he never tell?Where’s your mom? Where’s her lover? Where is Nanny Estelle?Are they going for the pressure? Are they always too high?Are you bad for the future? Are you going to die?Love me, love me, I’m just a lonely boy, soda pop and toysLove me, love me, I’m just a lonely boy, soda pop and toys",

Ziobro, co zło, a co dobro?Jeszcze odróżniasz? Mam wątpliwości.Stróż prawilności?

Pfft, ganz was NeuesJohn Lennon hat das schon in den Siebzigern gemachtHat ja richtig was gebrachtDu machst ein Lied gegen die gemeine WeltUnd in China hat gerade jemand Reis bestelltDann kommt der Krieg wieder, dann begreifst du schnellMusik ist keine LösungDie Melodie löst bei ihnen Hoffnung ausHeute hebt das Festivalgesocks die FaustAber morgen wachen sie in ihrer Kotze aufMusik ist keine LösungWas willst du? Menschen mit deinen Liedern tragen?Von der schiefen Bahn zur Zivilcourage?Über allen Krisen-Staaten Friedensfahnen?Willst du noch 'ne Niere haben?Denkst du, du bist jetzt die Stimme der Gesellschaft?Die finden dich, solange cool, bis du Geld hastVielleicht wirst du von manchen für den mutigen Schritt geliebtAndere sagen: „Der will doch nur gute Publicity!“Nein, es ist nicht leicht, du musst Gegenwind verkraftenZweifelhafte Leute aus der falschen Ecke werden für die nächste Single klatschenZum Beispiel  Anzug-getarnte, rechtsextrem gesinnte SpastenDie dein Video posten, weil sie kalkulierte Jagd auf jugendliche Wählerstimmen machenKlar, denn keiner versteht deine Texte nach einer Jever-PaletteDu hast mehr Schnapsleichen auf dem Gewissen, als Leben gerettetDie Satire wirst du schwer im Dorf erläuternEs sind Perlen vor die SäuferSchenk den Menschen Botschaften und dein TemperamentSie werden nur darüber streiten, wer dich länger kennt;Glaub mal nicht, dass da irgendetwas hängenbleibtAußer dem Download der MP3Du machst ein Lied gegen die gemeine WeltUnd in China hat gerade jemand Reis bestelltDann kommt der Krieg wieder, dann begreifst du schnellMusik ist keine LösungDie Melodie löst bei ihnen Hoffnung ausHeute hebt das Festivalgesocks die FaustAber morgen wachen sie in ihrer Kotze aufMusik ist keine LösungWenn du alles soviel besser weißt, du WunderknabeWarum sitzt du nicht im Bundestag, hä?Hast dir gedacht der Job als Protestsänger ist krisensicherDoch wäre Weltfrieden braucht man deine Lieder nicht mehrWenn man die Geiseln in Guantánamo befreitUnd das Weltklima wieder einen Status Quo erreichtMuss ich darauf hinweisen, ohne schadenfroh zu seinDu singst dich in die ArbeitslosigkeitGib es zu — du brauchst die Tränen, die AngstDie Hero-Junks, die Krebs ErkranktenDie Schlägerbanden, den MädchenhandelDie Denunzianten von nebenanDie Militär-Tyrannen, die Hate-KampagnenDie Karriere-Schlampen, die LaserschrankenDie toxigenen Substanzen, die in den Meeren landenDer Planet geht baden, doch wir geh'n zusammen!Schenk dir ein und du siehst, dich bemerkt keinerDas Glas ist halb-leer, MeisterErlaub den Zweifeln deinen Kopf zu fickenDenn es steckt immer noch Mist in jedem OptimistenMach's wie wir, uns ist die Schöpfung latteWenn Gott nur sieben Tage braucht, kann er's ja öfters machenStumpf Gitarre und Schreibfüller einDu wirst unbesiegbar durch GleichgültigkeitNichts ist mehr schlimm, und verwerflichNimm dir ein Zimmer mit MeerblickWährend sich unten das Gesindel beerdigtGib die Menschheit—Ich bin noch nicht fertig!Gib die Menschheit auf, Kaliba, du verschwendest deine KunstSie wollen Änderung, doch sagen ihre Hände wär'n gebundenDa sie dunkle Mächte lenken, blah, sie quengeln wieder rumAber die Menschen sind nicht böse, die Menschen sind nur dumm",

Для чего?Птицы в небесах летаютОпавший лист зелёный по воде плывётА я всё не понимаюО ком она у дуба каждый день поётЛай-лай-лай-лайЛай-лай-лай-лайНо со спины моей сняла она кувшинкуПриставила к своим роскошным волосамИ на лице увидел я милую улыбкуЧего там говорить, улыбнулся я и самАх, какой смешной и наивный пареньДумает, что не замечаю я егоКак она мила…Ведь любит точно, знаю (Точно, знаю)С ума меня свела…Зачем он прячется? Для чего?Птицы в небесах летаютОпавший лист зелёный по воде плывётА я всё не понимаюО ком она у дуба каждый день поётЛай-лай-лай-лай (Поёт!)Лай-лай-лай-лайЛай-лай-лай-лайЛай-лай-лай-лай",

heard stories and she's heard fablesThat I'm vicious on the mic and the turntablesThis young reporter I did adoreSo I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did beforeShe said: Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with youThe Casanova legend must have been trueI said: By the way baby what's your nameSaid: I go by the name of Lois LaneAnd you could be my boyfriend, you surely canJust let me quit my boyfriend called SupermanI said he's a fairy, I do supposeFlying through the air in pantyhoseHe may be very sexy or even cuteBut he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suitI said you need a man who's got finesseAnd his whole name across his chestHe may be able to fly all through the nightBut can he rock a party till the early lightHe can't satisfy you with his little wormBut I can bust you out with my super spermI go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do itAn I'm here, and I'm there, I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhereJust throw your hands up in the airAnd party hardy like you just don't careLet's

beat, beat, it's so uniqueCome on, everybody, and dance to the beatHave you ever went over a friend's house to eatAnd the food just ain't no goodI mean, the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushedAnd the chicken tastes like woodSo you try to play it off like you think you canBy saying that you're fullAnd then your friend says: Momma, he's just being politeHe ain't finished uh-uh, that's bullSo your heart starts pumping and you think of a lieAnd you say that you already ateAnd your friend says: Man, there's plenty of foodSo you pile some more on your plateWhile the stinky food's steaming, your mind starts to dreamingOf the moment that it's time to leaveAnd then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rottingInto something that looks like cheeseOh, so you say: That's it, I got to leave this placeI don't care what these people thinkI'm just sitting here making myself nauseousWith this ugly food that stinksSo you bust out the door while its still closedStill sick from the food you ateAnd then you run to the store for quick reliefFrom a bottle of KaopectateAnd then you call your friend two weeks laterTo see how he has beenAnd he says: I understand about the foodBaby, but bubbah, we're still friendsWith the hip hop, the hippie, the hippieTo the hip, hip hop and you don't stopThe rock it to the bang, bang, boogieSay up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat",

My words but a whisper your deafness a SHOUT.I may make you feel but I can't make you think.Your sperm's in the gutter your love's in the sink.So you ride yourselves over the fields andyou make all your animal deals andyour wise men don't know how it feels to be thick as a brick.And the sand-castle virtues are all swept away inthe tidal destructionthe moral melee.The elastic retreat rings the close of play as the last wave uncoversthe newfangled way.But your new shoes are worn at the heels andyour suntan does rapidly peel andyour wise men don't know how it feels to be thick as a brick. And the love that I feel is so far away:I'm a bad dream that I just had today and youshake your head andsay it's a shame. Spin me back down the years and the days of my youth.Draw the lace and black curtains and shut out the whole truth.Spin me down the long ages: let them sing the song. See there!  A son is born and we pronounce him fit to fight.There are black-heads on his shoulders, and he pees himself in the night.We'llmake a man of himput him to tradeteach himto play Monopoly andto sing in the rain. The Poet and the painter casting shadows on the wateras the sun plays on the infantry returning from the sea.The do-er and the thinker: no allowance for the otheras the failing light illuminates the mercenary's creed.The home fire burning: the kettle almost boilingbut the master of the house is far away.The horses stamping their warm breath cloudingin the sharp and frosty morning of the day.And the poet lifts his pen while the soldier sheaths his sword. And the youngest of the family is moving with authority.Building castles by the sea, he dares the tardy tide to wash them all aside. The cattle quietly grazing at the grass down by the riverwhere the swelling mountain water moves onward to the sea:the builder of the castles renews the age-old purposeand contemplates the milking girl whose offer is his need.The young men of the household haveall gone into service andare not to be expected for a year.The innocent young master thoughts moving ever fasterhas formed the plan to change the man he seems.And the poet sheaths his pen while the soldier lifts his sword. And the oldest of the family is moving with authority.Coming from across the sea, he challenges the son who puts him to the run. What do you do whenthe old man's gone do you want to be him?  Andyour real self sings the song.Do you want to free him?No one to help you get up steamand the whirlpool turns you way off beam. LATER.I've come down from the upper class to mend your rotten ways.My father was a man-of-power whom everyone obeyed.So come on all you criminals!I've got to put you straight just like I did with my old mantwenty years too late.Your bread and water's going cold.Your hair is too short and neat.I'll judge you all and make damn sure that no-one judges me. You curl your toes in fun as you smile at everyone you meet the stares.You're unaware that your doings aren't done.And you laugh most ruthlessly as you tell us what not to be.But how are we supposed to see where we should run?I see you shuffle in the courtroom withyour rings upon your fingers andyour downy little sidies andyour silver-buckle shoes.Playing at the hard case, you follow the example of the comic-paper idolwho lets you bend the rules. So!Come on ye childhood heroes!Won't you rise up from the pages of your comic-booksyour super crooksand show us all the way.Well!  Make your will and testament. Won't you?Join your local government.We'll have Superman for presidentlet Robin save the day. You put your bet on number one and it comes up every time.The other kids have all backed down and they put you first in line.And so you finally ask yourself just how big you areand take your place in a wiser world of bigger motor cars.And you wonder who to call on. So! Where the hell was Biggles when you needed him last Saturday?And where were all the sportsmen who always pulled you though?They're all resting down in Cornwallwriting up their memoirs for a paper-back editionof the Boy Scout Manual. LATER.See there! A man born and we pronounce him fit for peace.There's a load lifted from his shoulders with the discovery of his disease.We'lltake the child from himput it to the testteach itto be a wise manhow to fool the rest. QUOTEWe will be geared to the average rather than the exceptionalGod is an overwhelming responsibilitywe walked through the maternity ward and saw 218 babies wearing nylonscats are on the upgradeupgrade? Hipgrave. Oh, Mac. LATERIn the clear white circles of morning wonder,I take my place with the lord of the hills.And the blue-eyed soldiers stand slightly discoloured (in neat little rows)sporting canvas frills.With their jock-straps pinching, they slouch to attention,while queueing for sarnies at the office canteen.Saying -- how's your granny andgood old Ernie: he coughed up a tenner on a premium bond win.The legends (worded in the ancient tribal hymn) lie cradledin the seagull's call.And all the promises they made are ground beneath the sadist's fall.The poet and the wise man stand behind the gun,and signal for the crack of dawn.Light the sun. Do you believe in the day? Do you?Believe in the day! The Dawn Creation of the Kings has begun.Soft Venus (lonely maiden) brings the ageless one.Do you believe in the day?The fading hero has returned to the night and fully pregnant with the day,wise men endorse the poet's sight.Do you believe in the day? Do you? Believe in the day! Let me tell you the tales of your life ofyour love and the cut of the knifethe tireless oppressionthe wisdom instilledthe desire to kill or be killed.Let me sing of the losers who lie in the street as the last bus goes by.The pavements ar empty: the gutters run red while the fooltoasts his god in the sky.So come all ye young men who are building castles!Kindly state the time of the year and join your voices in a hellish chorus.Mark the precise nature of your fear.Let me help you pick up your dead as the sins of the father are fedwiththe blood of the fools andthe thoughts of the wise andfrom the pan under your bed.Let me make you a present of song asthe wise man breaks wind and is gone whilethe fool with the hour-glass is cooking his goose andthe nursery rhyme winds along.So! Come all ye young men who are building castles!Kindly state the time of the year and join your voices in a hellish chorus.Mark the precise nature of your fear.See! The summer lightning casts its bolts upon youand the hour of judgement draweth near.Would you bethe fool stood in his suit of armour orthe wiser man who rushes clear.So! Come on ye childhood heroes!Won't your rise up from the pages of your comic-booksyour super-crooks andshow us all the way.Well! Make your will and testament.Won't you? Join your local government.We'll have Superman for presidentlet Robin save the day.So!

Will my heart return to white?Can you tell me who you are? Can you tell me where I am?I've forgotten how to see, I've forgotten if I canIf I opened up my eyes, there'd be no more going back'Cause I'd throw it all away, and it all will fade to blackSo I'm back here once again, so I'm back here once againCan I ever make a change? Will my heart begin to mend?Would you love me if I go? It feels like a heart attackBut still everything's the same, and it all just fades to black (Black)",

Can we start again?(Ever since this started aching)Because I need you(Now we're stangers, but I need you)Oh I wonder if you need me too",

Wait, never mindLate night in passing mentioned it flippedTo her best friend, it's nothing, maybe it slippedBut the slip turns to terror, and a crush to likeThen she walked in, he froze up, believe it's the frightIt's cute in a way 'til you cannot speakAnd you leave to have a cigarette and knees get weakEscape was just a nod and a casual waveObsess about it heavy for the next two daysIt's only just a crush, it'll go awayIt's just like all the others, it'll go awayOr maybe this is danger, and he just don't knowYou pray it all away, but it continues to growI want to hold you close, skin pressed against me tightLie still, close your eyes, girl, so lovely, it feels so rightI want to hold you close, soft breast, beating heartAs I whisper in your ear, \"I wanna fucking tear you apart\"Then he walked up and told her, thinking maybe it'd passAnd they talked and looked away a lot, doing the danceHer hand brushed up against his, she left it thereTold him how she felt and then they locked in a stareThey took a step back, thought about it, what should they do?'Cause there's always repercussions when you're dating in schoolBut their lips met, and reservations started to passWhether this was just an evening or a thing that would lastEither way, he wanted her, and this was badWanted to do things to her, it was making him crazyNow a little crush turned into a likeAnd now he wants to grab her by the hair and tell herI want to hold you close, skin pressed against me tightLie still, close your eyes, girl, so lovely, it feels so rightI want to hold you close, soft breast, beating heartAs I whisper in your ear, \"I wanna fucking tear you apart\"I want to hold you close, skin pressed against me tightLie still, close your eyes, girl, so lovely, it feels so rightI want to hold you close, soft breast, beating heartAs I whisper in your ear, \"I wanna fucking tear you apart\"I want to hold you close, skin pressed against me tightLie still, close your eyes, girl, so lovely, it feels so rightI want to hold you close, soft breast, beating heartAs I whisper in your ear, \"I wanna fucking tear you apart\"",
