Fish pay attention to the moon?!\nWow! Who knew? (Again)\nDid you know...\nWhat?\n...that I could go to Japan and back?\nYou're kidding me! Amazing... geez\nPolluted water can kill both baby salmon that are developing\nAnd the adult salmon that are on their way to spawn\nWow, what a shame, what a shame\nHuh? Whoa!\nWow, hey, kids, hey, give it up for Sammy the Salmon\nAnd his amazing Salmon Dance\nHuh, what do you say? Alright\nWho's hungry?",

Es así\nComo te digo una cosa, te digo la otra\n¡Qué horror, hasta mis debilidades son más fuertes que yo!\n\nYa está, cuánta ambigüedad, esta vida me va a matar\nMi corazón vacío no soporta una ausencia más\nY sé que dijo una vez el Nobel de la Paz asesinado al caer:\n\"Es lo malo de ser bueno en este mundo cruel\"\nYa está, cuánta ambigüedad, esta vida me va a matar\nMi corazón vacío no soporta una ausencia más\nY sé que dijo una vez el Nobel de la Paz asesinado al caer:\n\"Es lo malo de ser bueno en este mundo cruel\"\n\"Es lo malo de ser bueno en este mundo cruel\"\n\"Es lo malo de ser bueno en este mundo cruel\"",

Wanna put you in a maze, lack of a place, no space, such a waste\nEnemy! How to gеt it make it drop? Wanna feel me pop? And now I'm gonna make you stop, ha!\n\nOn my wings of hеll\nGonna claim my right\nLet me rule the realm\nOr I will make it fire\n\nDid you forget? I am the one\nAnd if you run, every beat will knock you down\nGive me the crown out of a stone\nI'll take you all to the kingdom of my own\n\nWelcome to my festival of lights\nI will raise your souls, I will raise your hearts\n\nEnemy! Just to get on a trace, I follow your pace, this chase, I'd like a race\nEnemy! Wanna get a money prize of lemon size? I feel you wanna demonize\nEnemy!

My head is spinning\nUp, around, around and\nDown to the pub, up to the club!\nMy stomach's turning\nOh, my body's burning\nOur liquid lives, this is how we all survive\nHere's a story about a chap named Garf:\nDrank four pints in a hour 'n' a half\nThough the night had just begun\nBecause his local pub's open 'till one\nThe next morning out in the country\nHung over and on a hunt he\nWas still drunk and he pissed himself;\nFell off his horse and shot himself!\nSpinning! My head is spinning\nUp, around, around and\nDown to the pub, up to the club!\nMy stomach's turning\nOh, my body's burning\nOur liquid lives, this is how we all survive\nHave a drink, have a drink, have a drink…\nOur liquid lives! (x 8)\n\nDrink! Smoke! Fuck! Fight!\nOur liquid lives!\nOur liquid lives!\nThis is how we all survive!\nHere's a story about a girl named Kate:\nGot wasted and got date raped\nWhen they'd told the doctors she'd seen\nThey found no chemicals in her bloodstream\nWell, nothing malicious\nBut the alcohol level was suspicious\nWhen asked who'd hurt her\nPoor old Kate couldn't remember!\nSpinning! My head is spinning\nUp, around, around and\nDown to the pub, up to the club!\nMy stomach's turning\nOh, my body's burning\nOur liquid lives, this is how we all survive\nDrink! Smoke! Fuck!

Dann kann ich die Standpauke halten\nDu musst schuld sein, sonst will ich zu Sandstaub zerfallen\nMach den einen falschen Step und ich bleibe im Recht\nBau das Drama, das mich in die Freiheit entlässt\nUnd das ohne Abschied zu nehmen von meiner weißen Weste\n„Baby, gib mir nur 'nen Grund zu tun, wofür ich sonst keine Eier hätte!“\n\nIn jalousiebedeckter Wohnung amüsierst du dich alleine\nDu hörst Iggy Pop – dann fick ihn doch!\nDurch zeugenlose Wald und Wiesen gehst du Gassi\nMit dem Hund in einem Minirock – dann fick ihn doch!\nAn euphorieberaubten Tagen frequentierst du eine Kirche\nUnd du sprichst mit Gott – dann fick ihn doch!\nAlles tippitop und das fickt mein' Kopf\nDann fick ihn doch, fick ihn doch!\n\n„Die Fortsetzung dieser Szene hat der Staatsanwalt abgeschnitten und in seine Privatsammlung genommen.“",

Давай, соври\nВсё, что ты не сказал — это та же ложь\nТвоё личное горе горит внутри\nИ сжигает тебя, пока ты живёшь\nДа, наверное, ты слишком сложный друг\nИ, конечно, один можешь так любить\nВсе планеты и звёзды стоят вокруг\nПока ты продолжаешь опять скулить\nЭто боль всего мира, да ладно, блин\nТы страдаешь так много, а толку ноль\nНе для каждого клина найдётся клин\nНо для каждого мира найдётся боль\nИ это боль всего мира",

beat\n\nNow, what you hear is not a test, I'm rapping to the beat\nAnd me, the groove and my friends are gonna try to move your feet\nSee, I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say hello\nTo the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow\n\nBut first, I gotta bang, bang, the boogie to the boogie\nSay up, jump the boogie, to the bang, bang, boogie\nLet's rock, you don't stop\nRock the rhythm that'll make your body rock\n\nWell, so far you've heard my voice, but I brought two friends along\nAnd next on the mic is my man Hank, come on, Hank, sing that song\n\nWell, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies pimp\nThe women fight for my delight\nBut I'm the grandmaster with the three MC's\nThat shock the house for the young ladies\n\nAnd when you come inside, into the front\nYou do the freak, spank, and do the bump\nAnd when the sucker emcees try to prove a point\nWe're treacherous trio, uh, with a serious joint\n\nA from Sun to Sun, and from day to day\nI sit down and write a brand new rhyme\nBecause they say that miracles never cease\nI've created a devastating masterpiece\n\nI'm gonna rock the mic till you can't resist\nEverybody, I say it goes like this\nWell I was coming home late one dark afternoon\nReporter stopped me for a interview\n\nShe said she's heard stories and she's heard fables\nThat I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables\nThis young reporter I did adore\nSo I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before\n\nShe said: Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you\nThe Casanova legend must have been true\nI said: By the way baby what's your name\nSaid: I go by the name of Lois Lane\nAnd you could be my boyfriend, you surely can\nJust let me quit my boyfriend called Superman\n\nI said he's a fairy, I do suppose\nFlying through the air in pantyhose\nHe may be very sexy or even cute\nBut he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit\nI said you need a man who's got finesse\nAnd his whole name across his chest\n\nHe may be able to fly all through the night\nBut can he rock a party till the early light\nHe can't satisfy you with his little worm\nBut I can bust you out with my super sperm\n\nI go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it\nAn I'm here, and I'm there, I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere\nJust throw your hands up in the air\nAnd party hardy like you just don't care\nLet's do it, uh, don't stop y'all, uh, tick a tock y'all, you don't stop\n\nI go: Hotel, motel, what you gonna do today (say what?)\nI'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spank and drive off in a Def OJ\nEverybody go: Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn\nYou see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend\n\nI say skip, dive, what can I say\nI can't fit em all inside my OJ\nSo I just take half and bust them out\nI give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house\n\nI said M-A-S, a T-E-R, a G with a double E\nI said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee\nWell, my name is known all over the world\nBy all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls\nI'm going down in history\nAs the baddest rapper there ever could be\n\nNow I'm feeling the highs and you're feeling the lows\nThe beat starts getting into your toes\nYou start popping your fingers and stomping your feet\nAnd moving your body while you're sitting in your seat\n\nAnd then, damn, you start doing the freak\nI said damn, right outta your seat\nThen you throw your hands high in the air\nYou're rocking to the rhythm, shake your derriere\n\nYou're rocking to the beat without a care\nWith the sure-shot MC's for the affair\nNow, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang\nBut I rap to the beat just the same\n\nI got a little face and a pair of brown eyes\nAll I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize\nSinging on and on, and on, on and on\nThe beat don't stop until the break of dawn\n\nSinging on, on and on, and on, on and on\nLike a hot ready to pop, the pop, the pop, dibbie, dibbie\nPop, the pop, pop, you don't dare stop\nCome alive y'all, gimme what you got\n\nI guess by now you can take a hunch\nAnd find that I am the baby of the bunch\nBut that's okay, I still keep in stride\nCause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind\n\nSinging on and on, and on, on and on\nThe beat don't stop until the break of dawn\nSinging on and on, and on, on and on\nRock, rock, y'all get on the floor\n\nI'm gonna freak ya here, I'm gonna freak you there\nI'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere\nCause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind\nI'll put t-t-tickets in your behind\n\nI said 1-2-3-4, come on, girls, get on the floor\nUh, come alive y'all, gimme what ya got\nCause I'm guaranteed to make you rock\nI said 1-2-3-4, tell me, Wonder Mike, what are you waiting for?\n\nI said a hip hop, the hippie, the hippie\nTo the hip, hip hop and you don't stop\nThe rock it to the bang, bang, boogie\nSay up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat\n\nSkiddlee, beebop, a we rock a Scooby Doo\nAnd guess what, America: We love you\nCause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul\nYou could rock till you're a hundred and one years old\n\nI don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast\nBut we like hot butter on a

over a friend's house to eat\nAnd the food just ain't no good\nI mean, the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed\nAnd the chicken tastes like wood\n\nSo you try to play it off like you think you can\nBy saying that you're full\nAnd then your friend says: Momma, he's just being polite\nHe ain't finished uh-uh, that's bull\n\nSo your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie\nAnd you say that you already ate\nAnd your friend says: Man, there's plenty of food\nSo you pile some more on your plate\n\nWhile the stinky food's steaming, your mind starts to dreaming\nOf the moment that it's time to leave\nAnd then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rotting\nInto something that looks like cheese\n\nOh, so you say: That's it, I got to leave this place\nI don't care what these people think\nI'm just sitting here making myself nauseous\nWith this ugly food that stinks\n\nSo you bust out the door while its still closed\nStill sick from the food you ate\nAnd then you run to the store for quick relief\nFrom a bottle of Kaopectate\n\nAnd then you call your friend two weeks later\nTo see how he has been\nAnd he says: I understand about the food\nBaby, but bubbah, we're still friends\n\nWith the hip hop, the hippie, the hippie\nTo the hip, hip hop and you don't stop\nThe rock it to the bang, bang, boogie\nSay up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the

A son is born and we pronounce him fit to fight.\nThere are black-heads on his shoulders, and he pees himself in the night.\nWe'll\nmake a man of him\nput him to trade\nteach him\nto play Monopoly and\nto sing in the rain.\n \nThe Poet and the painter casting shadows on the water\nas the sun plays on the infantry returning from the sea.\nThe do-er and the thinker: no allowance for the other\nas the failing light illuminates the mercenary's creed.\nThe home fire burning: the kettle almost boiling\nbut the master of the house is far away.\nThe horses stamping their warm breath clouding\nin the sharp and frosty morning of the day.\nAnd the poet lifts his pen while the soldier sheaths his sword.\n \nAnd the youngest of the family is moving with authority.\nBuilding castles by the sea, he dares the tardy tide to wash them all aside.\n \nThe cattle quietly grazing at the grass down by the river\nwhere the swelling mountain water moves onward to the sea:\nthe builder of the castles renews the age-old purpose\nand contemplates the milking girl whose offer is his need.\nThe young men of the household have\nall gone into service and\nare not to be expected for a year.\nThe innocent young master thoughts moving ever faster\nhas formed the plan to change the man he seems.\nAnd the poet sheaths his pen while the soldier lifts his sword.\n \nAnd the oldest of the family is moving with authority.\nComing from across the sea, he challenges the son who puts him to the run.\n \nWhat do you do when\nthe old man's gone do you want to be him?  And\nyour real self sings the song.\nDo you want to free him?\nNo one to help you get up steam\nand the whirlpool turns you way off beam.\n \nLATER.\nI've come down from the upper class to mend your rotten ways.\nMy father was a man-of-power whom everyone obeyed.\nSo come on all you criminals!\nI've got to put you straight just like I did with my old man\ntwenty years too late.\nYour bread and water's going cold.\nYour hair is too short and neat.\nI'll judge you all and make damn sure that no-one judges me.\n \nYou curl your toes in fun as you smile at everyone you meet the stares.\nYou're unaware that your doings aren't done.\nAnd you laugh most ruthlessly as you tell us what not to be.\nBut how are we supposed to see where we should run?\nI see you shuffle in the courtroom with\nyour rings upon your fingers and\nyour downy little sidies and\nyour silver-buckle shoes.\nPlaying at the hard case, you follow the example of the comic-paper idol\nwho lets you bend the rules.\n \nSo!\nCome on ye childhood heroes!\nWon't you rise up from the pages of your comic-books\nyour super crooks\nand show us all the way.\nWell!  Make your will and testament. Won't you?\nJoin your local government.\nWe'll have Superman for president\nlet Robin save the day.\n \nYou put your bet on number one and it comes up every time.\nThe other kids have all backed down and they put you first in line.\nAnd so you finally ask yourself just how big you are\nand take your place in a wiser world of bigger motor cars.\nAnd you wonder who to call on.\n \nSo! Where the hell was Biggles when you needed him last Saturday?\nAnd where were all the sportsmen who always pulled you though?\nThey're all resting down in Cornwall\nwriting up their memoirs for a paper-back edition\nof the Boy Scout Manual.\n \nLATER.\nSee there! A man born and we pronounce him fit for peace.\nThere's a load lifted from his shoulders with the discovery of his disease.\nWe'll\ntake the child from him\nput it to the test\nteach it\nto be a wise man\nhow to fool the rest.\n \nQUOTE\nWe will be geared to the average rather than the exceptional\nGod is an overwhelming responsibility\nwe walked through the maternity ward and saw 218 babies wearing nylons\ncats are on the upgrade\nupgrade? Hipgrave. Oh, Mac.\n \nLATER\nIn the clear white circles of morning wonder,\nI take my place with the lord of the hills.\nAnd the blue-eyed soldiers stand slightly discoloured (in neat little rows)\nsporting canvas frills.\nWith their jock-straps pinching, they slouch to attention,\nwhile queueing for sarnies at the office canteen.\nSaying -- how's your granny and\ngood old Ernie: he coughed up a tenner on a premium bond win.\n\nThe legends (worded in the ancient tribal hymn) lie cradled\nin the seagull's call.\nAnd all the promises they made are ground beneath the sadist's fall.\nThe poet and the wise man stand behind the gun,\nand signal for the crack of dawn.\nLight the sun.\n \nDo you believe in the day? Do you?\nBelieve in the day! The Dawn Creation of the Kings has begun.\nSoft Venus (lonely maiden) brings the ageless one.\nDo you believe in the day?\nThe fading hero has returned to the night and fully pregnant with the day,\nwise men endorse the poet's sight.\nDo you believe in the day? Do you? Believe in the day!\n \nLet me tell you the tales of your life of\nyour love and the cut of the knife\nthe tireless oppression\nthe wisdom instilled\nthe desire to kill or be killed.\nLet me sing of the losers who lie in the street as the last bus goes by.\nThe pavements ar empty: the gutters run red while the fool\ntoasts his god in the sky.\n\nSo come all ye young men who are building castles!\nKindly state the time of the year and join your voices in a hellish chorus.\nMark the precise nature of your fear.\nLet me help you pick up your dead as the sins of the father are fed\nwith\nthe blood of the fools and\nthe thoughts of the wise and\nfrom the pan under your bed.\nLet me make you a present of song as\nthe wise man breaks wind and is gone while\nthe fool with the hour-glass is cooking his goose and\nthe nursery rhyme winds along.\n\nSo! Come all ye young men who are building castles!\nKindly state the time of the year and join your voices in a hellish chorus.\nMark the precise nature of your fear.\nSee! The summer lightning casts its bolts upon you\nand the hour of judgement draweth near.\nWould you be\nthe fool stood in his suit of armour or\nthe wiser man who rushes clear.\nSo! Come on ye childhood heroes!\nWon't your rise up from the pages of your comic-books\nyour super-crooks and\nshow us all the way.\nWell! Make your will and testament.\nWon't you? Join your local government.\nWe'll have Superman for president\nlet Robin save the day.\nSo! Where the hell was Biggles when you needed him last Saturday?\nAnd where were all the sportsmen who always pulled you through?\nThey're all resting down in Cornwall writing up their memoirs\nfor a paper-back edition of the Boy Scout Manual.\n \nOF COURSE\nSo you ride yourselves over the fields and\nyou make all your animal deals and\nyour wise men don't know how it feels to be thick as a brick.",

Will my heart return to white?\nCan you tell me who you are? Can you tell me where I am?\nI've forgotten how to see, I've forgotten if I can\nIf I opened up my eyes, there'd be no more going back\n'Cause I'd throw it all away, and it all will fade to black\n\nSo I'm back here once again, so I'm back here once again\nCan I ever make a change? Will my heart begin to mend?\nWould you love me if I go? It feels like a heart attack\nBut still everything's the same, and it all just fades to black (Black)",

Work that dexterity\nLean back now, here's what I meant\nGetting cooler by 20 percent\n\nYeah I own this beat\nYou can call me the king or the ruler\nFelon on bass, getting hoarse at the mic\nWe're getting 20 percent cooler\nWe had a great day out\nCalling my name like Ferris Bueller\nIt's time to wrap this up\nWe're getting 20 percent cooler\nWe're getting 20 percent cooler\nWe're getting 20 percent cooler\nWe're getting 20 percent cooler\nWe're getting 20 percent cooler\n\nYeah I own this beat\nYou can call me the king or the ruler\nFelon on bass, getting hoarse at the mic\nWe're getting 20 percent cooler\nWe had a great day out\nCalling my name like Ferris Bueller\nIt's time to wrap this up\nWe're getting 20 percent cooler",

Наши глаза от слёз ослепли\nК ненависти огня тянутся вверх красные стебли\nСолнца наших сердец медленно гаснут искрами в пепле\nКаждый из нас уже мертвец, тянутся вверх красные стебли\n\nВсегда нуждою других себя занимая\nВсегда, что-то красивое творя\nМы движемся в сторону рая\nЧерез ненависть и моря\nНе каждый из нас на том берегу будет\nНе каждый сможет туда доплыть\nСквозь шторма своих судеб\nНо всё может быть\n\nПламя внутри тебя и меня. Наши глаза от слёз ослепли\nК ненависти огня тянутся вверх красные стебли\nСолнца наших сердец медленно гаснут искрами в пепле\nКаждый из нас уже мертвец, тянутся вверх красные стебли",
