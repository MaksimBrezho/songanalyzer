We got so much street credit, the fuckin' police let us\nNow that's bullshit, cause we don't pack heat\nSo come and get your head crackin' up at me\n\nKick it, movin' it's on now\nMaking it punk loud\nShaking the buck wild\nRapin' the punk style\nFakin' the funk pal\nDunk watch the punk\nWhat now? Watch your battleship get sunk down\nClick, pow, nine, thou, what? Just what I thought what's up now?\nClick, pow, nine, thou, what? Just what I thought what's up now?\nHu, I'm like hu-hu\n\nHold it down, never give in\nStyles ever get limbs\nOr whether you want it to end\nDirty syringe, I burn 'em again\n'97, serving them since\nOr thirty your friends get knocked out, turbulent wind\nHopped out, what you want, bare bourbon and gin\nI'm a fish, you can tell by the hookers & fins\nC'mon\n\nYo!, I got a rock style\nPivot the offspring and joke with 'em\nWith a distorted guitar stream\nWho am I? Russian roulette? Who and Tak?\nPushin' your bed hotter than Quebec in July\nArea 5-1, stereo, rive gun live\nHere we go, S-O-B drop some\nFor the kids in the hall with the new block tape\nBlast from both angles like Boondock Saints\nSo get up, get up and let the sound hit ya\nSnap this audio-style picture, uh!\n\nKick it, movin' it's on now\nMaking it punk loud\nShaking the buck wild\nRapin' the punk style\nFakin' the funk pal\nDunk watch the punk\nWhat now?
