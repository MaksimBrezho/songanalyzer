We got so much street credit, the fuckin' police let us\nNow that's bullshit, cause we don't pack heat\nSo come and get your head crackin' up at me\n\nKick it, movin' it's on now\nMaking it punk loud\nShaking the buck wild\nRapin' the punk style\nFakin' the funk pal\nDunk watch the punk\nWhat now? Watch your battleship get sunk down\nClick, pow, nine, thou, what? Just what I thought what's up now?\nClick, pow, nine, thou, what? Just what I thought what's up now?\nHu, I'm like hu-hu\n\nHold it down, never give in\nStyles ever get limbs\nOr whether you want it to end\nDirty syringe, I burn 'em again\n'97, serving them since\nOr thirty your friends get knocked out, turbulent wind\nHopped out, what you want, bare bourbon and gin\nI'm a fish, you can tell by the hookers & fins\nC'mon\n\nYo!, I got a rock style\nPivot the offspring and joke with 'em\nWith a distorted guitar stream\nWho am I? Russian roulette? Who and Tak?\nPushin' your bed hotter than Quebec in July\nArea 5-1, stereo, rive gun live\nHere we go, S-O-B drop some\nFor the kids in the hall with the new block tape\nBlast from both angles like Boondock Saints\nSo get up, get up and let the sound hit ya\nSnap this audio-style picture, uh!\n\nKick it, movin' it's on now\nMaking it punk loud\nShaking the buck wild\nRapin' the punk style\nFakin' the funk pal\nDunk watch the punk\nWhat now? Watch your battleship get sunk down\nClick, pow, nine, thou, what? Just what I thought what's up now?\nClick, pow, nine, thou, what? Just what I thought what's up now?\n\nUh!, Who the hell wear splittin' the belly up on a selfish\nShinnin' in your style playin' the fell blitz\nDrillin' your brain, like rap and video games\nSpin the syringe, with the Styles, stick it into your veins\n\nYo!, what kind of shit is he on?\n(Really is Styles, really)\nBe on, C'mon punk fuck off, you really gotta be gone\nRipped out of your brain\nPiss covered in shit to dispossess your B-game\nSon of a bitch, I'm gonna start killing for kicks\nThey're in an Air Force One, on the globe, I can't fit, get it?\nI'm sick with it, when I spit the venom and it drips up in 'it\nAnd it gets the women in a quick dilemma, we can settle it now\nAnd I don't know who did it but they said it was Styles\n\nClick, pow, nine, thou, what? Just what I thought what's up now?\nHu, I'm like hu-hu\nHu, I'm like hu-hu\nClick, pow, nine, thou, what? Just what I thought what's up now?\nClick, pow, nine, thou, what?

Hey, what's up, old man?\nI see that you're embarking on another epic quest\nYou're gonna use your Ocarina to rescue the princess\nBut you'll need a magic weapon that'll never ever miss\nIt's dangerous to go alone, take this!\nOh, thanks, old man, that is really very nice\nI can always count on you for help and friendly advice\nThough I've never seen a sword of quite that shape or size\nOh, God, that's not a sword, it's your dick in disguise\n\nYes, I can't lie, I have painted my schween\nNow grab your destiny, if you know what I mean\nWait a minute, Link, don't leave the cave, where do you think you're going?\nThis is a great chance to fondle old scrotum that you're blowing\n\nThat was weird, but whatever, there is no time to lose\nI gotta warp right now to Zelda in this chilled-out groove\nWait, this isn't Ganon's lair, I'm in Liberty City\nThis place looks just like Philadelphia, but even more shitty\nI'm at the corner of Dead Cop and Prostitute Junction\nSomething in my Ocarina must have gone and malfunctioned\nI gotta fix it quickly, there is justice to do\nHold on a minute, Link! Old man, is that you?\nThis is a place you can't survive with just your sword and your wits\nIt's dangerous to go alone, take this!\nWell, that's really kind of— Gah! That's your wrinkled dick again\nLook, I know I wear a tunic, but I'm not into men\n\nDon't be that way, bitch, let me introduce you\nTo my three best friends, Mr. Johnson and the Juice Crew\nIf you save the princess Zelda, well, you know you're gonna grab her\nSo why don't you try to come grab my inflatable poo-jabber?\n(Oh my God!)\n\nI gotta warp outta here, Princess Zelda awaits\nI must defeat Ganondorf before it gets too late\nOkay, now I really don't know where I am\nHold on a minute, Link! Goddamn it, old man!\nYou're in Raccoon City, it's a zombie abyss\nIt's dangerous to go alone, take—\n\nNo! Fuck you! Fuck you!\nI'm not giving you a-\nI'm not touching your w-\nStop the chilled-out groove!\nGeez!\nYou come in here tellin' me you got a wee-wee weapon\nIt's not cool, I'm not gonna touch it, I'm not gonna s-\nNo!\nSo is that a no on the handjob, or...?\nOkay"

Do kids ever get enough?\nWhen it’s time to close the store, they will always ask for more\nBut that is life\nWhen you\nLove me, love me, I’m just a lonely boy, give me soda pop and toys\nLove me, love me, please a little candy girl, take those chocolates from the boys\n\n(They're eating, They're eating, They're eating way too fast\nThey're eating, They're eating)\nAnd this is for the devil in the picture that you couldn’t believe\nIt’s the truth of the agony you couldn’t achieve\nSo where’s your daddy sleeping over? Why did he never tell?\nWhere’s your mom? Where’s her lover? Where is Nanny Estelle?\nAre they going for the pressure? Are they always too high?\nAre you bad for the future? Are you going to die?\nLove me, love me, I’m just a lonely boy, soda pop and toys\nLove me, love me, I’m just a lonely boy, soda pop and toys"

I don't know\nBut I'll soon find out, that's for sure\nWhy did you play me this way?\n\nWell, I guess what you say is true\nI could never be the right kind of girl for you\n\nI could never be your woman\nI could never be your woman\nI could never be your woman\nI could never be your woman\n\nWell, I guess what they say is true\nI could never spend my life with a man like you\n\nI could never be your woman\nI could never be your woman\nI could never be your woman\nI could never be your woman"

And now I'm gonna make you stop, ha!\n\nOn my wings of hеll\nGonna claim my right\nLet me rule the realm\nOr I will make it fire\n\nDid you forget?

Я буду на рассвете\nПусть волосы мне развевает не попутный ветер\nВ этом сером городе я бодр, свеж и светел\nВижу цель, вижу преграды — а как их не заметить?!\n\nЯ делаю шаг\n\nСумбурные толпы людей\nСтолько пар ног, столько путей\nБесцельно блуждающих в этой плоскости дней\nЯ точно такой же, но немного живей\n\nЯ делаю шаг\nЯ делаю шаг\nЯ делаю шаг\nЯ делаю шаг\n\nЯ делаю шаг\nЯ делаю шаг\nЯ делаю шаг\nЯ делаю шаг"

I've got some LPs\nThat are 100 times funkier than Black Eyed Peas!\nCrazy balalaikas from 1965!\nYou've been dreaming to hear this shit\nAll of your life\n\nWhen there's no vodka left\nWhat shall we do, my friends?\nLets forget our troubles\nAnd DANCE!\n\nThe wheels go round, the beat goes faster\nMy favorite tune on the Sovietoblaster!\nAnd everyone here drinks vodka and beer\nAnd the dancing queen from Kyiv, Ukraine\nDrives every boy insane!\nThe wheels go round, the beat goes faster\nMy favorite tune on the Sovietoblaster!\nAnd everyone here drinks vodka and beer\nAnd the dancing queen from Kyiv, Ukraine\nDrives every boy insane!"

Так тому и быть\n\nИ мертвец, гремя костями, вдруг поднялся из земли:\n«Довели меня, проклятые, ей-богу, довели!»\nВоры вмиг переглянулись, и помчались наутёк\nА мертвец всё золото с собой в могилу уволок"

beat\n\nNow, what you hear is not a test, I'm rapping to the beat\nAnd me, the groove and my friends are gonna try to move your feet\nSee, I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say hello\nTo the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow\n\nBut first, I gotta bang, bang, the boogie to the boogie\nSay up, jump the boogie, to the bang, bang, boogie\nLet's rock, you don't stop\nRock the rhythm that'll make your body rock\n\nWell, so far you've heard my voice, but I brought two friends along\nAnd next on the mic is my man Hank, come on, Hank, sing that song\n\nWell, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies pimp\nThe women fight for my delight\nBut I'm the grandmaster with the three MC's\nThat shock the house for the young ladies\n\nAnd when you come inside, into the front\nYou do the freak, spank, and do the bump\nAnd when the sucker emcees try to prove a point\nWe're treacherous trio, uh, with a serious joint\n\nA from Sun to Sun, and from day to day\nI sit down and write a brand new rhyme\nBecause they say that miracles never cease\nI've created a devastating masterpiece\n\nI'm gonna rock the mic till you can't resist\nEverybody, I say it goes like this\nWell I was coming home late one dark afternoon\nReporter stopped me for a interview\n\nShe said she's heard stories and she's heard fables\nThat I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables\nThis young reporter I did adore\nSo I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before\n\nShe said: Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you\nThe Casanova legend must have been true\nI said: By the way baby what's your name\nSaid: I go by the name of Lois Lane\nAnd you could be my boyfriend, you surely can\nJust let me quit my boyfriend called Superman\n\nI said he's a fairy, I do suppose\nFlying through the air in pantyhose\nHe may be very sexy or even cute\nBut he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit\nI said you need a man who's got finesse\nAnd his whole name across his chest\n\nHe may be able to fly all through the night\nBut can he rock a party till the early light\nHe can't satisfy you with his little worm\nBut I can bust you out with my super sperm\n\nI go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it\nAn I'm here, and I'm there, I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere\nJust throw your hands up in the air\nAnd party hardy like you just don't care\nLet's do it, uh, don't stop y'all, uh, tick a tock y'all, you don't stop\n\nI go: Hotel, motel, what you gonna do today (say what?)\nI'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spank and drive off in a Def OJ\nEverybody go: Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn\nYou see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend\n\nI say skip, dive, what can I say\nI can't fit em all inside my OJ\nSo I just take half and bust them out\nI give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house\n\nI said M-A-S, a T-E-R, a G with a double E\nI said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee\nWell, my name is known all over the world\nBy all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls\nI'm going down in history\nAs the baddest rapper there ever could be\n\nNow I'm feeling the highs and you're feeling the lows\nThe beat starts getting into your toes\nYou start popping your fingers and stomping your feet\nAnd moving your body while you're sitting in your seat\n\nAnd then, damn, you start doing the freak\nI said damn, right outta your seat\nThen you throw your hands high in the air\nYou're rocking to the rhythm, shake your derriere\n\nYou're rocking to the beat without a care\nWith the sure-shot MC's for the affair\nNow, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang\nBut I rap to the beat just the same\n\nI got a little face and a pair of brown eyes\nAll I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize\nSinging on and on, and on, on and on\nThe beat don't stop until the break of dawn\n\nSinging on, on and on, and on, on and on\nLike a hot ready to pop, the pop, the pop, dibbie, dibbie\nPop, the pop, pop, you don't dare stop\nCome alive y'all, gimme what you got\n\nI guess by now you can take a hunch\nAnd find that I am the baby of the bunch\nBut that's okay, I still keep in stride\nCause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind\n\nSinging on and on, and on, on and on\nThe beat don't stop until the break of dawn\nSinging on and on, and on, on and on\nRock, rock, y'all get on the floor\n\nI'm gonna freak ya here, I'm gonna freak you there\nI'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere\nCause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind\nI'll put t-t-tickets in your behind\n\nI said 1-2-3-4, come on, girls, get on the floor\nUh, come alive y'all, gimme what ya got\nCause I'm guaranteed to make you rock\nI said 1-2-3-4, tell me, Wonder Mike, what are you waiting for?\n\nI said a hip hop, the hippie, the hippie\nTo the hip, hip hop and you don't stop\nThe rock it to the bang, bang, boogie\nSay up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat\n\nSkiddlee, beebop, a we rock a Scooby Doo\nAnd guess what, America: We love you\nCause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul\nYou could rock till you're a hundred and one years old\n\nI don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast\nBut we like hot butter on a breakfast toast\nRock it up, uh, baby bubbah\nBaby bubbah, to the boogie, the bang, bang, the boogie\nTo the beat, beat, it's so unique\nCome on, everybody, and dance to the beat\n\nHave you ever went over a friend's house to eat\nAnd the food just ain't no good\nI mean, the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed\nAnd the chicken tastes like wood\n\nSo you try to play it off like you think you can\nBy saying that you're full\nAnd then your friend says: Momma, he's just being polite\nHe ain't finished uh-uh, that's bull\n\nSo your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie\nAnd you say that you already ate\nAnd your friend says: Man, there's plenty of food\nSo you pile some more on your plate\n\nWhile the stinky food's steaming, your mind starts to dreaming\nOf the moment that it's time to leave\nAnd then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rotting\nInto something that looks like cheese\n\nOh, so you say: That's it, I got to leave this place\nI don't care what these people think\nI'm just sitting here making myself nauseous\nWith this ugly food that stinks\n\nSo you bust out the door while its still closed\nStill sick from the food you ate\nAnd then you run to the store for quick relief\nFrom a bottle of Kaopectate\n\nAnd then you call your friend two weeks later\nTo see how he has been\nAnd he says: I understand about the food\nBaby, but bubbah, we're still friends\n\nWith the hip hop, the hippie, the hippie\nTo the hip, hip hop and you don't stop\nThe rock it to the bang, bang, boogie\nSay up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat"

Sono problemi tuoi\n\nIo voglio passare ad un livello successivo\nVoglio dare vita a ciò che scrivo\nSono paranoico ed ossessivo\nFino all'abiura di me\nVado ad un livello successivo\nDove dare vita a ciò che scrivo\nSono paranoico ed ossessivo\nFino all'abiura di me\nAbiura di me, abiura di me\nAbiura di me, di me, di me\nAbiura di me, abiura di me\nAbiura di me, di me\n\nStai calmo\nChe punteggio basso\n\nLa corte condanna il signor Rezza Capa ad anni dieci di lavori socialmente utili come spalatore di cacca di elefanti circensi. La seduta è sciolta, viva lo spazioporto!"

A son is born and we pronounce him fit to fight.\nThere are black-heads on his shoulders, and he pees himself in the night.\nWe'll\nmake a man of him\nput him to trade\nteach him\nto play Monopoly and\nto sing in the rain.\n \nThe Poet and the painter casting shadows on the water\nas the sun plays on the infantry returning from the sea.\nThe do-er and the thinker: no allowance for the other\nas the failing light illuminates the mercenary's creed.\nThe home fire burning: the kettle almost boiling\nbut the master of the house is far away.\nThe horses stamping their warm breath clouding\nin the sharp and frosty morning of the day.\nAnd the poet lifts his pen while the soldier sheaths his sword.\n \nAnd the youngest of the family is moving with authority.\nBuilding castles by the sea, he dares the tardy tide to wash them all aside.\n \nThe cattle quietly grazing at the grass down by the river\nwhere the swelling mountain water moves onward to the sea:\nthe builder of the castles renews the age-old purpose\nand contemplates the milking girl whose offer is his need.\nThe young men of the household have\nall gone into service and\nare not to be expected for a year.\nThe innocent young master thoughts moving ever faster\nhas formed the plan to change the man he seems.\nAnd the poet sheaths his pen while the soldier lifts his sword.\n \nAnd the oldest of the family is moving with authority.\nComing from across the sea, he challenges the son who puts him to the run.\n \nWhat do you do when\nthe old man's gone do you want to be him?  And\nyour real self sings the song.\nDo you want to free him?\nNo one to help you get up steam\nand the whirlpool turns you way off beam.\n \nLATER.\nI've come down from the upper class to mend your rotten ways.\nMy father was a man-of-power whom everyone obeyed.\nSo come on all you criminals!\nI've got to put you straight just like I did with my old man\ntwenty years too late.\nYour bread and water's going cold.\nYour hair is too short and neat.\nI'll judge you all and make damn sure that no-one judges me.\n \nYou curl your toes in fun as you smile at everyone you meet the stares.\nYou're unaware that your doings aren't done.\nAnd you laugh most ruthlessly as you tell us what not to be.\nBut how are we supposed to see where we should run?\nI see you shuffle in the courtroom with\nyour rings upon your fingers and\nyour downy little sidies and\nyour silver-buckle shoes.\nPlaying at the hard case, you follow the example of the comic-paper idol\nwho lets you bend the rules.\n \nSo!\nCome on ye childhood heroes!\nWon't you rise up from the pages of your comic-books\nyour super crooks\nand show us all the way.\nWell!

Do you?\nBelieve in the day! The Dawn Creation of the Kings has begun.\nSoft Venus (lonely maiden) brings the ageless one.\nDo you believe in the day?\nThe fading hero has returned to the night and fully pregnant with the day,\nwise men endorse the poet's sight.\nDo you believe in the day? Do you? Believe in the day!\n \nLet me tell you the tales of your life of\nyour love and the cut of the knife\nthe tireless oppression\nthe wisdom instilled\nthe desire to kill or be killed.\nLet me sing of the losers who lie in the street as the last bus goes by.\nThe pavements ar empty: the gutters run red while the fool\ntoasts his god in the sky.\n\nSo come all ye young men who are building castles!\nKindly state the time of the year and join your voices in a hellish chorus.\nMark the precise nature of your fear.\nLet me help you pick up your dead as the sins of the father are fed\nwith\nthe blood of the fools and\nthe thoughts of the wise and\nfrom the pan under your bed.\nLet me make you a present of song as\nthe wise man breaks wind and is gone while\nthe fool with the hour-glass is cooking his goose and\nthe nursery rhyme winds along.\n\nSo! Come all ye young men who are building castles!\nKindly state the time of the year and join your voices in a hellish chorus.\nMark the precise nature of your fear.\nSee!

I've done everything I can\nAll the people that I see, they will never understand\nIf I find a way to change, if I step into the light\nThen I'll never be the same, and it all will fade to white\n\nEver on and on, I continue circling\nWith nothing but my hate in a carousel of agony\n'Til slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing\nAnd suddenly I see that I can't break free\nI'm slipping through the cracks of a dark eternity\nWith nothing but my pain and the paralyzing agony\nTo tell me who I am, who I was, uncertainty\nEnveloping my mind 'til I can't break free and\n\nMaybe it's a dream, maybe nothing else is real\nBut it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel\nSo I'm tired of all the pain, of the misery inside\nAnd I wish that I could live feeling nothing but the night\nYou can tell me what to say, you can tell me where to go\nBut I doubt that I would care, and my heart would never know\nIf I make another move, there'll be no more turning back\nBecause everything will change and it all will fade to black\n\nWill tomorrow ever come? Will I make it through the night?\nWill there ever be a place for the broken in the light?\nAm I hurting? Am I sad? Should I stay or should I go?\nI've forgotten how to tell, did I ever even know?\nThis time you're not hurting me, this time I will take a stand\nAll the hatred in my eyes building up an evil plan\nStanding lonely in the night, with the darkness by my side\nLooking deep inside myself and revealing only fright\n\nIf I make another move, if I take another step\nThen it all would fall apart, there'd be nothing of me left\nIf I'm crying in the wind, if I'm crying in the night\nWill there ever be a way? Will my heart return to white?\nCan you tell me who you are? Can you tell me where I am?\nI've forgotten how to see, I've forgotten if I can\nIf I opened up my eyes, there'd be no more going back\n'Cause I'd throw it all away, and it all will fade to black\n\nSo I'm back here once again, so I'm back here once again\nCan I ever make a change? Will my heart begin to mend?\nWould you love me if I go? It feels like a heart attack\nBut still everything's the same, and it all just fades to black (Black)"

If this feelin' flows both ways?\n(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay\n(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made\nFor sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day\n\nCrawlin' back to you (Crawlin' back to you)\nEver thought of callin' when\nYou've had a few? (Had a few)\n'Cause I always do ('Cause I always do)\nMaybe I'm too (Maybe I'm too busy)\nBusy bein' yours (Bein' yours)\nTo fall for somebody new\nNow, I've thought it through\nCrawlin' back to you\n\n(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?\n(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay\n(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made\nFor sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day\n(Do I wanna know?) Too busy bein' yours to fall\n(Sad to see you go) Ever thought of callin', darlin'?\n(Do I wanna know?) Do you want me crawlin' back to you?"

Who can believe you?\nLet your mother pray\nSugar\nSugar\n\nI'm not there all the time, you know\nSome people, some people, some people call it insane\nYeah, they call it insane (Sugar)\nI play Russian Roulette every day, a man's sport\nWith a bullet called life\nYeah, mama called life (Sugar)\nYeah and every time I try to go where I really want to be\nIt's already where I am\n'Cause I'm already there\n\nThe Kombucha mushroom people, sitting around all day\nWho can believe you? Who can believe you?\nLet your mother pray\nSugar\n\nI got a gun the other day from Sako\nIt's cute, it's small, fits right in my pocket\nYeah, right in my pocket (Sugar)\nMy girl, you know, she lashes out at me sometimes\nAnd I just fucking kick her\nAnd then, ooh baby, she's okay (Sugar)\nPeople are always chasin' me down, tryin' to push my face to the ground\nWhere all they do is suck out my motherfucking brains\nMy brains (Sugar!)\n\nThe Kombucha mushroom people, sitting around all day\nWho can believe you? Who can believe you?\nLet your mother pray\n\nI sit in my desolate room\nNo lights, no music\nJust anger! (I've killed everyone)\nI'm away forever, but I'm feeling better\nHow do I feel? What do I say?\nFuck you, it all goes away\nHow do I feel? What do I say?\nFuck you, it all goes away\nHow do I feel? What do I say?\nIn the end, it all goes away\nHow do I feel? What do I say?\nIn the end, it all goes away\nHow do I feel? What do I say?\nIn the end, it all goes away\nHow do I feel? What do I say?\nIn the end, it all goes away\nHow do I feel? What do I say?\nIn the end, it all goes away\nHow do I feel? What do I say?\nIn the end, it all goes away\nIn the end, it all goes away\nIn the end, it all goes away\nIn the end, it all goes away\nIn the end, it all goes away"
