We got so much street credit, the fuckin' police let us\nNow that's bullshit, cause we don't pack heat\nSo come and get your head crackin' up at me\n\nKick it, movin' it's on now\nMaking it punk loud\nShaking the buck wild\nRapin' the punk style\nFakin' the funk pal\nDunk watch the punk\nWhat now? Watch your battleship get sunk down\nClick, pow, nine, thou, what? Just what I thought what's up now?\nClick, pow, nine, thou, what? Just what I thought what's up now?\nHu, I'm like hu-hu\n\nHold it down, never give in\nStyles ever get limbs\nOr whether you want it to end\nDirty syringe, I burn 'em again\n'97, serving them since\nOr thirty your friends get knocked out, turbulent wind\nHopped out, what you want, bare bourbon and gin\nI'm a fish, you can tell by the hookers & fins\nC'mon\n\nYo!, I got a rock style\nPivot the offspring and joke with 'em\nWith a distorted guitar stream\nWho am I? Russian roulette? Who and Tak?\nPushin' your bed hotter than Quebec in July\nArea 5-1, stereo, rive gun live\nHere we go, S-O-B drop some\nFor the kids in the hall with the new block tape\nBlast from both angles like Boondock Saints\nSo get up, get up and let the sound hit ya\nSnap this audio-style picture, uh!\n\nKick it, movin' it's on now\nMaking it punk loud\nShaking the buck wild\nRapin' the punk style\nFakin' the funk pal\nDunk watch the punk\nWhat now? Watch your battleship get sunk down\nClick, pow, nine, thou, what? Just what I thought what's up now?\nClick, pow, nine, thou, what? Just what I thought what's up now?\n\nUh!, Who the hell wear splittin' the belly up on a selfish\nShinnin' in your style playin' the fell blitz\nDrillin' your brain, like rap and video games\nSpin the syringe, with the Styles, stick it into your veins\n\nYo!, what kind of shit is he on?\n(Really is Styles, really)\nBe on, C'mon punk fuck off, you really gotta be gone\nRipped out of your brain\nPiss covered in shit to dispossess your B-game\nSon of a bitch, I'm gonna start killing for kicks\nThey're in an Air Force One, on the globe, I can't fit, get it?\nI'm sick with it, when I spit the venom and it drips up in 'it\nAnd it gets the women in a quick dilemma, we can settle it now\nAnd I don't know who did it but they said it was Styles\n\nClick, pow, nine, thou, what?

Fish pay attention to the moon?!\nWow! Who knew? (Again)\nDid you know...\nWhat?\n...that I could go to Japan and back?\nYou're kidding me! Amazing... geez\nPolluted water can kill both baby salmon that are developing\nAnd the adult salmon that are on their way to spawn\nWow, what a shame, what a shame\nHuh? Whoa!\nWow, hey, kids, hey, give it up for Sammy the Salmon\nAnd his amazing Salmon Dance\nHuh, what do you say? Alright\nWho's hungry?",

That's your wrinkled dick again\nLook, I know I wear a tunic, but I'm not into men\n\nDon't be that way, bitch, let me introduce you\nTo my three best friends, Mr. Johnson and the Juice Crew\nIf you save the princess Zelda, well, you know you're gonna grab her\nSo why don't you try to come grab my inflatable poo-jabber?\n(Oh my God!)\n\nI gotta warp outta here, Princess Zelda awaits\nI must defeat Ganondorf before it gets too late\nOkay, now I really don't know where I am\nHold on a minute, Link!

My head is spinning\nUp, around, around and\nDown to the pub, up to the club!\nMy stomach's turning\nOh, my body's burning\nOur liquid lives, this is how we all survive\nHere's a story about a chap named Garf:\nDrank four pints in a hour 'n' a half\nThough the night had just begun\nBecause his local pub's open 'till one\nThe next morning out in the country\nHung over and on a hunt he\nWas still drunk and he pissed himself;\nFell off his horse and shot himself!\nSpinning! My head is spinning\nUp, around, around and\nDown to the pub, up to the club!\nMy stomach's turning\nOh, my body's burning\nOur liquid lives, this is how we all survive\nHave a drink, have a drink, have a drink…\nOur liquid lives! (x 8)\n\nDrink! Smoke! Fuck! Fight!\nOur liquid lives!\nOur liquid lives!\nThis is how we all survive!\nHere's a story about a girl named Kate:\nGot wasted and got date raped\nWhen they'd told the doctors she'd seen\nThey found no chemicals in her bloodstream\nWell, nothing malicious\nBut the alcohol level was suspicious\nWhen asked who'd hurt her\nPoor old Kate couldn't remember!\nSpinning! My head is spinning\nUp, around, around and\nDown to the pub, up to the club!\nMy stomach's turning\nOh, my body's burning\nOur liquid lives, this is how we all survive\nDrink! Smoke! Fuck!

    "lyrics": "Imagine me and you, I do\nI think about you day and night, it's only right\nTo think about the girl you love and hold her tight\nSo happy together\nIf I should call you up, invest a dime\nAnd you say you belong to me, and ease my mind\nImagine how the world could be, so very fine\nSo happy together\n\nImagine me and you\nI do but I'm thinking too much, 'cause I'm studying\nHow they tossed the dice\nIt had to be simpler back in the day when our folks were pretty certain\nThey could find someone, now none of it's assigned\nWe just want to date, whеther deaf or blind or dumb\nI look at your number and wondеr if I should call you up\nAnd invest a dime\nIn a message with text that doesn't belong to me\nBut it would ease my mind to know if the songs I'm singing\nAre in a key you can comprehend\nIn tune with the thoughts you were pondering\nIf so, we can both stop wondering if we'll\nBe together like Donner and Blitzen\nBut all reindeer games aside\nIt's like right when you came here, I came alive\nIt's like everything else was a glimpse of you\nGiving hints and clues of where your name resides\nNow that I've found you, it's changed the vibe\nShatters through all the blame, fear, shame, and pride\nDoesn't matter who calls and invests a dime\nGet a message saying, \"We're staying inside\"\n'Cause I imagine you and me can make music beautifully\nCan make moves, never lose the beat\nI can imagine the food that we'd choose to eat\nI see it all, like a view from a movie seat\nAnd imagine you and me never knew that we\nWere never more than a few degrees\nAnd how good it would prove to be\nWhen the waiting is over, I finally found you and\n\nI can't see me loving nobody but you\nFor all my life\nWhen you're with me, baby, the skies'll be blue\nFor all my life\n\nMe and you, and you and me\nNo matter how they toss the dice, it had to be\nThe only one for me is you, and you for me\nSo happy together\n\nImagine me and you and you and me\nNo other way for we to be\nToss these dice eventually\nThese snake eyes spell a tragedy\nAnd I believe unhappily\nThis magic now a fantasy\nThere's another one for me than you\nAnd some other one for you than me\nAnd that's the way is has to be\nA non-completed masterpiece\nDeleted canvas, atrophy\nCut by another after me\nA silent wound whose lips confess\nLoves lost under love's duress\nA curse confessing hope and then\nReverse the blessing, emptiness\nThis hollow hole won't coalesce\nRegrets emote from hole in chest\nAs less remote emotions pour\nFrom cavities, growing depths\nI have it easy knowing this:\nTogether we will never fit\nSo I'd rather bind my mind with rhymes\nThan blind my eyes and sever it\n\nI can't see me loving nobody but you\nFor all my life\nWhen you're with me, baby, the skies'll be blue\nFor all my life\n\nBa-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba\nBa-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba\n\nMe and you, and you and me\nNo matter how they toss the dice, it had to be\nThe only one for me is you, and you for me\nSo happy together\nWe're happy together\nHow is the weather?\nSo happy together\n\nAnd I don't know and I can't think\nAnd I'm so smote that I can't speak\nAnd I look at the picture I have in my head\nAnd I won't doze and I can't sleep\nAnd it's so good that I'm knocked out\nAnd your quotes get put in my thoughts now\nAnd there's nobody else to distract me\n'Cause you got me on lockdown\nAnd I can't stop and I won't stop\nAnd we rock on, even show stop\nSo thank you for coming tonight, everyone\nWe're the Flobots",

Will I ever feel again?\nI'm a silhouette chasing rainbows on my own\nBut the more I try to move on, the more I feel alone\nSo I watch the summer stars to lead me home\n\nI'm sick of the past I can't erase\nA jumble of footprints and hasty steps I can't retrace\nThe mountain of things that I still regret\nIs a vile reminder that I would rather just forget\n(No matter where I go)\n\nThe fire I began is burning me alive\nBut I know better than to leave and let it die\n\nI'm a silhouette asking every now and then\nIs it over yet?

J'ai une grosse bite !”\nMais en fait j'suis juste excité car j'ai acheté quelques sapes au thrift shop\nLa glace sur les franges est tellement givrée\nLes gens sont genre “Putain, frais le beau-gosse”\nJ'arrive, m'enfonce, direction la mezzanine\nVêtu tout de rose sauf mes chaussures en croco, qui sont vertes\nJe porte un vison de léopard, une fille est débout à côté de moi\nJ'ai probablement dû lavé ça, il sent comme les draps de R. Kelly\n(Pisse)\nMais putain, ça coutait 99 cents\nJe m'en fous, je le porte, je le lave, je suis sur le point de sortir et me faire complimenter\nJe laisse passer ces mocassins dans lesquels quelqu'un d'autre a marché\nEn mode clodo et grunge, rien à foutre, je crâne et je me la pète et\nJ'économise et je suis putain d'heureux, ça c'est une affaire, pute\nJ'vais piquer le style de ton grand-père, j'vais piquer le style de ton grand-père\nNon, en vrai, demande à ton grand-père : “j'peux récupérer ses vieilles sapes?”\n(Merci !)\nCombinaison en velours et des chaussons d'intérieur\nVeste en cuir marron-merde que j'ai trouvé en fouillant\nIls avaient un clavier cassé, j'ai acheté un clavier cassé\nJ'ai acheté une couverture à foutre, puis j'ai acheté un kneeboard\nSalut, salut, mon gars ace, mon mellow\nJohn Wayne ne peut pas test niveau franges, oh non\nJe pourrais prendre des Pro Wings, les rendre cool, les vendre\nLes fans de baskets seraient genre “Ah, il a les Velcros”\n\nJe vais enlever quelques étiquettes\nAvec seulement 20 dollars dans ma poche\nJ'suis, j'suis à la chasse, à la recherche de bonnes affaires\nC'est vraiment énorme\nJe vais enlever quelques étiquettes\nAvec seulement 20 dollars dans ma poche\nJ'suis, j'suis à la chasse, à la recherche de bonnes affaires\nC'est vraiment énorme\n\nQu'est-ce que tu y connais au port du loup sur la caboche ?\nQu'est-ce que t'y connais au port d'un fourrure en renard ?\nJe fouille, je fouille, je cherche jusqu'au fond du bac\nLes déchets d'un homme sont la bonne pioche d'un autre\nRemercie ton grand-père pour son don d'une chemise écossaise\nCar là, je suis dans la place, je me la pète\nJe suis au Goodwill, tu peux me trouver dans les bacs\nJ'suis pas, j'suis pas bloqué dans cette section\nTa mamie, ta tata, ta maman, ta mama\nJe prends ces pyjamas zebrés en flanelle\nDe seconde main, et j'ai trop la putain d'classe avec\nLa putain de combinaison avec chaussettes intégrées\nJ'arrive à la soirée et putain tout le monde s'arrête\nIls disent: “Ce Gucci, c'est trop cool!”\nMoi je dix: “Yo, ça fait 50$ pour un t-shirt” !\nEdition limitée, faisons une simple addition\nCinquante dollars pour un t-shirt, c'est juste d'la merde de pute ignorante\nJ'appelle ça se faire avoir et se prostituer, ‘tain\nJ'appelle ça se faire piéger par le business\nCe t-shirt compte pour un max de blé\nEt avoir le même que six autres personnes dans le club j'y compte surtout pas\nCoup d'œil, vient jeter un regard à travers mon télescope\nT'essaies de choper des filles à l'aide d'une marque?\nMec t'y arriveras pas, mec t'y arriveras pas\n\n(Goodwill, poppin' tags, yeah)\n\nJe vais enlever quelques étiquettes\nAvec seulement 20 dollars dans ma poche\nJ'suis, j'suis à la chasse, à la recherche de bonnes affaires\nC'est vraiment énorme\n\nI wear your granddad's clothes\nI look incredible\nI’m in this big ass coat\nFrom that thrift shop down the road\nI wear your granddad's clothes\nI look incredible\nI’m in this big ass coat\nFrom that thrift shop down the road\n\nJe vais enlever quelques étiquettes\nAvec seulement 20 dollars dans ma poche\nJ'suis, j'suis à la chasse, à la recherche de bonnes affaires\nC'est vraiment énorme\n(C'est l'manteau d'ta grand-mère ?)",

In this four-minute-long track, Shadrow tells various tales about Muffet over a chiptune-heavy instrumental.\nStumbling around the darkness, I can't see the door\nThe walls are lined with something and so's the floor\nI hear her chilling laughter and see her smile\nShe tells me to sit and join her, \"Please stay a while\"\n\nCan't shake the feeling that I'm hanging by a thread\nIt seems to me she's trapped my soul inside her web\nShe hands to me, a tray of biscuits, tea, and bread\nI can't put my finger on it, can't put my finger on it\n\nThere's something weird about the way she speaks to me\nThere's something strange about the flavour of her tea\nI didn't have the means to keep her from this harmony\nShe's some kind of spider girl, some kind of spider girl\n\nThe party beat is thumping, she starts to dance\nHer friends come out together, caught in her trance\nWiping crumbs off the table, they join the feast\nEven her cutie-muffin is moving to the beat\n\nCan't shake the feeling that I'm hanging by a thread\nIt seems to me she's trapped my soul inside her web\nShe makes a motion for the tub of strawberry spread\nI can't put my finger on it, can't put my finger on it\n\nThere's something weird about the way she speaks to me\nThere's something strange about the flavour of her tea\nI didn't have the means to keep her from this harmony\nShe's some kind of spider girl, some kind of spider girl\n\n\nThere's something weird about the way she speaks to me\nThere's something strange about the flavour of her tea\nI didn't have the means to keep her from this harmony\nShe's some kind of spider girl, some kind of spider girl\nThere's something weird about the way she speaks to me\nThere's something strange about the flavour of her tea\nShe's glaring angrily, turns out the meal wasn't free\nShe's some kind of spider girl, some kind of spider girl",

Will I make it through the night?\nWill there ever be a place for the broken in the light?\nAm I hurting? Am I sad? Should I stay, or should I go?\nI've forgotten how to tell, did I ever even know?\nCan I take another step?

Will my heart return to white?\nCan you tell me who you are? Can you tell me where I am?\nI've forgotten how to see, I've forgotten if I can\nIf I opened up my eyes, there'd be no more going back\n'Cause I'd throw it all away, and it all will fade to black\n\nSo I'm back here once again, so I'm back here once again\nCan I ever make a change? Will my heart begin to mend?\nWould you love me if I go? It feels like a heart attack\nBut still everything's the same, and it all just fades to black (Black)",

O-o)\nI was up above it (Oh! O-o) Now I'm down in it\nI was up above it (Oh! O-o)\nI was up above it (Oh! O-o)\nNow I'm down in it\n\nShut up! So what? What does it matter now?\nI was swimmin' in the haze, now I crawl on the ground\nAnd everything I never liked about you\nIs kind of seeping into me\nTry to laugh about it now\nBut isn't it funny how everything works out?\n\"I guess the joke's on me,\" she said\n\nI was up above it (Oh! O-o)\nI was up above it (Oh! O-o) Now I'm down in it\nI was up above it (Oh! O-o)\nI was up above it (Oh! O-o) (Now I'm down in it)\n\nI used to be so big and strong\nI used to know my right from wrong\nI used to never be afraid\nI used to be somebody!\nI used to have something inside\nNow just this hole that's open wide\nI used to want it all\nI used to be somebody\n\nI'll cross my heart, I'll hope to die\nBut the needle's already in my eye\nAnd all the world's weight is on my back\nAnd I don't even know why\nAnd what I used to think was me\nIs just a fading memory\nI looked him right in the eye\nAnd said goodbye\n\nI was up above it (Oh! O-o)\nI was up above it (Oh! O-o) Now I'm down in it (Now I'm down in it)\nI was up above it (Oh! O-o)\nI was up above it (Oh! O-o) (Now I'm down in it)\nI was up above it (Oh!

Сколько прожито дней?\nЭто кто как считает, для кого как важней\nЧто-то сделано мною или сделано что-то\nИ что для себя, ну а что для кого-то\nСчастье — в секундах, маленьких, острых\nЩедрое к детям и скупое для взрослых\nЛипкой почкой набухнет долгожданной весною\nЧтобы осенью стать в костре горящей листвою\n\nОткрой мне дверь, и я войду\nИ принесу с собою осень\nИ, если ты меня попросишь\nТебе отдам её я всю\n\nОткрой мне дверь, и я войду\nИ принесу с собою осень\nИ, если ты меня попросишь\nТебе отдам её я всю\nОткрой мне дверь, и я войду\nИ принесу с собою осень\nИ, если ты меня попросишь\nТебе отдам её я всю",

(Орки!)\nГойда, орки!\nГойда, орки!\nГойда, орки!\nГой-да-да!\n\nПускаем газы и нефть бурим\nПусть курит Третий Рейх, мы — Третий Рим!\nРешит начальник за нас с тобой\nКто грузом 200 полетит домой!\nСмотрите! Орки!\nОрки!\nОрки!\nК нам спустились с горки!\nПуть обречённых\nПоезда заключённых\nПлемена отречённых\n\"Новичок\" в труселя!\nСмех прокажённых\nМаски лиц искажённых\nВ сладкий сон погружённых\nИ сырая земля\nРычат в лесах шаманы\nБурлят в котлах дурманы\nУходят караваны на Западный Кордон\nТанцуют скоморохи\nЧтоб не скучали лохи\nИ мчались в караоке встречать Армагеддон\n\nГойда, орки!\nГойда, орки!\nГойда, орки!\nГой-да-да! (Орки!)\nГойда, орки!\nГойда, орки!\nГойда, орки!\nГой-да-да! (Ууи!)\nПуть обречённых\nПоезда заключённых\nПлемена отречённых\nНовичок в труселя! (Орки!)\nСмех прокажённых\nМаски лиц искажённых\nВ сладкий сон погружённых\nИ сырая земля\nГойда, орки!\nГойда, орки!\nГойда, орки!\nГой-да-да! (Орки!)\nГойда, орки!\nГойда, орки!\nГойда, орки!\nГой-да-да!\n\nБум!",

Who can believe you?\nLet your mother pray\nSugar\nSugar\n\nI'm not there all the time, you know\nSome people, some people, some people call it insane\nYeah, they call it insane (Sugar)\nI play Russian Roulette every day, a man's sport\nWith a bullet called life\nYeah, mama called life (Sugar)\nYeah and every time I try to go where I really want to be\nIt's already where I am\n'Cause I'm already there\n\nThe Kombucha mushroom people, sitting around all day\nWho can believe you? Who can believe you?\nLet your mother pray\nSugar\n\nI got a gun the other day from Sako\nIt's cute, it's small, fits right in my pocket\nYeah, right in my pocket (Sugar)\nMy girl, you know, she lashes out at me sometimes\nAnd I just fucking kick her\nAnd then, ooh baby, she's okay (Sugar)\nPeople are always chasin' me down, tryin' to push my face to the ground\nWhere all they do is suck out my motherfucking brains\nMy brains (Sugar!)\n\nThe Kombucha mushroom people, sitting around all day\nWho can believe you? Who can believe you?\nLet your mother pray\n\nI sit in my desolate room\nNo lights, no music\nJust anger! (I've killed everyone)\nI'm away forever, but I'm feeling better\nHow do I feel? What do I say?\nFuck you, it all goes away\nHow do I feel? What do I say?\nFuck you, it all goes away\nHow do I feel? What do I say?\nIn the end, it all goes away\nHow do I feel?
